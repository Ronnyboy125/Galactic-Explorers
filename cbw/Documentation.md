## Project Description:
We built a web-based educational game to teach elementary-age students about space. The game is level-based, where a player travels from planet to planet, beginning on Earth. At each planet, the player completes minigames to collect resources, which they will use to modify their spacecraft to enable further space travel.

## Educational Content:
In order to complete the minigames on each planet, the player will learn various facts specific to the planet. The player will have to recall these facts to solve puzzles and progress through the game. In future work, the player could be required to infer solutions to problems based on learned facts to encourage rational thinking instead of just memorization.

## Future Improvement
We have implemented the basic concepts of the game, and future work would seek to build off of this. In addition to graphic design refinement and extending the game to include all the planets in the Solar System, we want to add more minigames and add more of a problem-solving aspect to the game. Specific improvements are listed in FutureWork.md

# User Interface and General Gameplay Issues/Fixes:
* In the Solar System screen, change the highlight feature so that when you hover over a locked planet, the highlight surrounds the planet itself instead of the planet and the text.
* In the Solar System screen, add a way to access a planet by clicking on the picture of the planet instead of just the text.
* In the maze minigame, add a check to make sure the materials do not spawn on the same square as the astronoaut. Or create a check that spawns the materials far away from the astronaut so that the user is pushed to explore more of the maze.
* In the maze minigame, fix a similar issue where both materials can spawn on the same square as each other.
* In the maze minigame, fix an issue where the user can still traverse the maze while a popup is on screen.
* On the trivia games, add a way to leave the minigame after a failed trivia attempt so that the user can visit the fact squares so they can learn the fact to then answer the questions correctly on their next attempt. And/or, make a fix so that the user must visit the fact squares before attempting the trivia game.
* On both the moon and mars screens, fix an issue where the user collects the same fact twice by collecting a fact on the fact squares, and by collecting that same fact from the trivia game itself.
* On both the moon and mars screens, fix an issue where the screen will scroll with the characters up and down movement once the user has collected a fact.  
# General Concepts:
* Add animation to the character throughout the game and add a spaceship icon on the space where the player leaves the planet they are on.
* Add a wider variety of music, as well as sound effects.
* Add a story to the game. Have some sort of call to action at the start, and a resolution at the end.
* Add a wider variety of minigames that have themes that relate to the minigame's respective planet.
# Mini Game Ideas:
* Mercury has the lowest gravity out of planets in the solar system. A game idea based on this is a platformer with low gravity, where the character must jump to question platforms and answer correctly to beat the level.
* Venus has many major volcanic features. A game idea based on this is a game where the character runs from spreading lava while collecting facts and answering questions.
* Mars has many dust storms. A game idea base on this is a game where the user dusts of debris on objects to uncover facts. 
* Jupiter has nearly 80 moons. A game idea based on this is a game where the user aims and releases moons into Jupiter's orbit. After each moon is released, the user learns a fact and at the end must answer a question to beat the game.
* Saturn has many rings around it. An idea for a game based on this is a game where the user must hop between saturn's rings to avoid obstacles and collect facts, while answering questions to weave around certain obstacles.
* Uranus is a gas giant, but due to its cold temperate the gasses often freeze and is called an "ice giant". A game idea based on this is a physics game where the user builds a path with ice to let their character slide to the spaceship while collecting facts along their path.
* Neptune has super high wind speeds. A game idea based on this would be a game where the user guides their spaceship away from high-speed space debris and into fact and triva debris.

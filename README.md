# Welcome to Whitworth University Computer Science Community Building Week!

This fall, we're kicking off the semester with an exciting challenge that brings together every computer science student for the first time in a competition that’s part game jam, part community-building exercise. This event is more than just a contest—it's an opportunity to learn, collaborate, and showcase the collective creativity of the student body.

Over the week, each team will design, develop, and present a game that pushes the boundaries of what we can achieve in a short timeframe. Whether you’re diving into new technologies, exploring innovative game mechanics, or simply enjoying the process of coding with peers, this competition is all about embracing the spirit of learning and having fun.

As this is the first time we’re doing this, it’s not just about winning—it’s about creating something we can all be proud of and strengthening the bonds within our community and each other. Let’s make this a week to remember, filled with creativity, collaboration, and maybe even a little bit of friendly competition.

The goal should be to learn, have fun, and enjoy the process, while still aiming to create something educational and meaningful. Here are some tips to help you make the most of the competition:

1. **Choose a Project That Excites You**

    Whether it’s a unique game mechanic, a story you want to tell, or a technology you want to explore, make sure it’s something that everyone is excited to work on.
    With that said your game's idea alone won’t win; it’s about how well you bring it to life. A polished, working game that demonstrates solid mechanics and design principles will stand out.
    Adding a unique twist to a common genre or implementing a feature in a novel way can make your game memorable.

2. **Focus on Learning Opportunities**

    **Experiment with New Tools or Techniquess**: Use this week as a chance to try out new game engines, programming languages, or design patterns that you’re curious about. It’s a great way to learn something new while working on a real project.

    **Encourage Team Members to Take on New Roles**: If someone is usually a programmer, maybe they can try out game design or art this time. This will help everyone grow their skill set.

3. **Emphasize Collaboration and Teamwork**

    **Foster an Open, Supportive Environments**: Encourage everyone to share ideas, ask questions, and help each other out. Collaboration is key to both learning and having fun.

    **Rotate Responsibilitiess**: Allow team members to switch roles periodically, so everyone gets a taste of different aspects of game development, from coding to design to testing.

4. **Iterate and Playtest Frequently**

    **Focus on Rapid Prototyping**: Start with simple prototypes that you can build on. This allows you to see progress quickly and helps keep motivation high.
    Enjoy the Playtesting Process: Gather feedback early and often, but keep it light and fun. Use playtesting sessions as a way to celebrate progress and bond as a team.

5. **Celebrate Small Wins**

    **Recognize Each Milestone**: Whether it’s getting your first character to move, implementing a cool mechanic, or solving a tricky bug, take time to appreciate each step forward.

    **Have Fun with the Presentation**: When it comes time to create a video presentation of your game, make it fun and engaging. You can incorporate humor, tell the story of your development journey, or even involve the audience in a demo if possible. 
    How you present your game is critical.
    Instead of just focusing on the end product, share your development process with the judges. Talk about what you learned, the obstacles you overcame, the design choices you made, the player experience and the fun moments along the way.

6. **Be Open to Change**

    **Adapt Based on What’s Fun**: If you discover that a certain aspect of the game isn’t as fun or interesting as you thought, don’t be afraid to pivot. Focus on what brings the most enjoyment to both the developers and players. Within the confines of the theme.

    **Keep the Pressure Low**: Remind yourselves that the primary goal is to learn and enjoy the process. If something doesn’t work out as planned, it’s just part of the learning experience.
    A game that evolves and improves throughout the week shows dedication and responsiveness, which can impress your professors.

7. **Document the Journey**

    **Keep a Devlog or Journal**: You will need to document your progress, the challenges you face, and the solutions you come up with. This can be a great learning tool and a fun way to look back on the experience. **It is required…**

8. **Enjoy the Final Product**

    **Celebrate the Game You Made**: Regardless of the outcome, take pride in the game you created. Play it together, share it with friends, and enjoy the satisfaction of having built something from scratch.
    Even simple games can be successful if they are polished and fun to play. Focus on making sure everything works smoothly, the user interface is intuitive, and the game is enjoyable.

9. Reflect on the Experience

    **Discuss What You Learned**: After the competition, take time to reflect on what you’ve learned. What went well? What could you improve next time? How did you grow as a team? This will be your self-reflection and evaluation (https://whitgit.whitworth.edu/2024/community-building-week/team_name/user_name/CBW_log_reflection).

    **Plan for Future Projects**: If you enjoyed the process, consider continuing the project or starting a new one with the same team. Keep the momentum going!


### **Keys to success**:

*By focusing on learning and fun, you’ll naturally create a game that’s engaging and reflects the passion and creativity of your team. Even if you don’t complete your game, the experience and skills you gain will be invaluable. Plus, having fun along the way ensures that the competition is a positive and memorable experience for everyone involved.*

*Winning or even completing a finished product is great, but the real value comes from the experience—learning new skills, collaborating with others, and pushing yourself creatively and technically. Competitions like this are fantastic opportunities to grow as a programmer, develop interpersonal skills, and understand how to work effectively within a team.*

*Enjoying the process makes the hard work feel less like a chore and more like an adventure. The lessons you learn during the competition will stick with you far longer than any trophy or prize. So dive in, experiment, take risks, and most importantly, have fun! The journey itself is the real reward.*

***Ultimately, success comes down to how well your team works together, how effectively you can implement your ideas, and how well you can present your game.***

**Prototype Early**: Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) to ensure the core mechanics work, then build on that foundation.

**Focus on One Key Feature**: Rather than spreading your efforts thin across many features, make one aspect of your game truly outstanding!

**Get Feedback**: Test your game with others as early as possible to identify and fix issues before the final submission.

**Keep It Simple but Refined**: A well-executed simple game often outshines a complex game that’s rough around the edges.

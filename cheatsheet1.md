# Cheat Sheet

## Day 1: Setting the Foundation

### Understand the Theme (from the Community Partner):
- Meet up, chat, and get excited! Make sure everyone gets the theme, but don't stress—interpret it in a way that excites you.
- Make sure everyone understands the core idea and expectations.

### Brainstorming Session:
- Brainstorm different interpretations of the theme.
- Focus on finding an exciting, innovative idea that ties directly to the provided theme.
- **Focus on Simplicity with a Twist**: The best games have a simple core mechanic with one standout twist. This doesn't have to be something grand, but it should hopefully be something unique and creative.
- **Filter Ideas**: Use criteria like "Is this mechanic easy to understand?" and most importantly "Can we execute this well within a week?"
- **Action**: Each team member should pitch ideas, with the group selecting the one with the most potential for creative/technical impressiveness and **educational value**.

### Define Scope and Features:
- Decide on the must-haves, but remember—keep it small at first, then expand. Think MVP (Minimal Viable Product): what’s the simplest version that’s still fun?
- Identify one key feature (e.g., unique game mechanic or innovation) that sets your game apart.
- **Action**: Write down the features, pick what’s critical, and save the rest for when you've got time to spare.

### Assign Roles Based on Strengths:
- Split your team into core roles (programming, art, sound, level design, etc.).
- Rotate responsibilities if needed, but ensure every person has clear tasks.
- **Action**: Make a task list for each person to focus on during the first two days.

## Day 2-3: Build Your MVP

### Rapid Prototyping:
- Time to get hands-on! Start with the most basic version of your game idea and make sure it's fun. Don’t worry about making it pretty—just get the mechanics down. This means building a basic version of your core mechanic (e.g., character movement, interaction with the environment, dialogue, basic levels, etc.) by the end of Day 2.
- Once the core mechanic is working, focus on adding depth, not complexity. Identify only a few additional features or levels to build around the core gameplay.
- Create a priority list—anything that doesn’t make it into the prototype should be deprioritized unless the core is solid.
- **Action**: Aim for a working prototype by the end of Day 2, you want a playable prototype with placeholder art.
- Test early with placeholder graphics to confirm that your game’s core mechanics are fun and functional.

### Art and Design Development:
- Begin early work on your art and sound assets. Keep the style consistent and simple for a polished look.
- **Action**: Design a style guide and produce basic sprites, sound effects, or models.
- Even basic pixel art or minimalist graphics can work well if they are consistent and match the game’s tone. Don’t worry about making it look perfect—just make it cohesive—aim for consistency.
- **Action**: Assign a team member or two to focus on creating sprites, backgrounds, and other visuals. Stick to a cohesive color palette, style guide, or draw basic sprites.
- **Implement Simple Sound Effects and Music**: Even simple sound effects can add a lot to your game’s polish. Choose or create music that matches the game’s atmosphere.
- **Action**: Gather free sound effects or make simple ones, like footsteps, jumps, or menu clicks. Background music should be non-intrusive and match the tone (e.g., upbeat, intense, chill, or bubbly and friendly).

### Iterate on Feedback:
- Test the game as a group. Identify any issues with the controls, balance, or game feel.
- **Action**: Make adjustments based on team feedback and prepare a second iteration of your MVP.
- Cut Feature Creep. Only include features that enhance the core mechanic or add replayability.
- Iterate Quickly… get feedback IMMEDIATELY and tweak the mechanic. Make sure it’s intuitive, fun, and functional. That’s it!

## Day 4-5: Build Out the Full Game

### Expand Features:
- Your game’s core mechanic works? Great! Now it’s time to sprinkle in extra levels, smarter AI, or more puzzles—just don’t overdo it.
- Focus on adding one or two standout elements that will make your game memorable (e.g., interesting AI, a compelling storyline, or complex puzzles).
- **Action**: Assign each team member a cool feature to build. Keep things moving and keep everyone engaged and involved!

### Level Design and Playtesting:
- Design levels that showcase your core mechanic and steadily increase the difficulty or depth to keep players engaged.
- **Action**: Have people playtest the game. Is it fun? Too hard? Too easy? Boring? Make quick changes and keep refining until it feels right.

## Day 6: Polish, Polish, Polish

### Refine the Game:
- Polish the controls, fix any bugs, and make sure the game feels satisfying to play. Don’t add new stuff—just make what’s there work well and you will do well.
- Once the core of the game is working and fun, resist the temptation to add new mechanics or features. Focus on fixing bugs, improving the user interface, and smoothing out gameplay.
- Spend Day 6 solely on polishing—removing clunky mechanics, fixing animation glitches, and making sure transitions (between levels, menus) are smooth.

### Tighten the Gameplay Loop:
- Ensure that the game loop (action, feedback, consequence) is tight and satisfying. The player should feel rewarded for each action they take. This is important.
- **Action**: Revisit controls, camera movement, and user feedback (e.g., sound effects, screen flashes, dialogue boxes) to make sure everything is crisp and responsive.
- **Action**: Squash bugs and clean up any clunky mechanics. Add the finishing touches. Whether it's cool transitions or fun sound effects, make sure the game feels cohesive and polished.

### Enhance Presentation and User Experience:
- Add subtle sound effects, music, and animation to make the game more immersive and enjoyable.
- **Action**: Ensure your game’s intro and instructions are clear and welcoming.

## Day 7: Final Playtesting and Presentation

### Final Playtesting:
- Have someone unfamiliar with the game playtest it. Use this feedback to make small, quick tweaks.
- **Final Playtest and Bug Fixes**: Have someone outside the team do the final playtest. Use this opportunity to catch any last-minute issues.
- **Action**: Dedicate the final few hours to bug-fixing, UI improvements, and smoothing out rough edges.
- **Action**: Finalize the game, focusing on any last-minute bugs or performance issues.

### Craft the Presentation:
- Prepare a clear, concise presentation about your game. Focus on what makes it unique and technically impressive.
- **Prepare a Short, Impactful Presentation**: You need to present your game in a way that quickly highlights what’s special about it. Explain the concept clearly and show off the unique twist right away.
- **Show the Best Parts First**: Don’t waste time on menus or long introductions during the presentation. Jump straight into gameplay that shows off your game’s strengths.

### Show Off What Makes It Special:
- When making your video, make it clear, quick, and fun! Show off the coolest parts right away, and get everyone excited about the game’s unique twist.

## Additional Keys to Success:

- **Focus on One Standout Mechanic**: Don’t try to do too much—make one part of your game (like the main gameplay loop) truly exceptional.
- **Get Feedback Early and Often**: Playtest often with fresh eyes. This will help you catch issues you might have missed.
- **Stay Organized**: Use a project management tool (Trello) or a shared document to track tasks, progress, and deadlines. Most importantly communicate with your team.
- **Stay Adaptable**: Be open to cutting less important features if time gets tight. Better to have a polished, simpler game than an unfinished complex one.
- **Keep Morale High**: Regular check-ins with your team to ensure no one feels overwhelmed, and celebrate small wins to keep motivation up.

## Checklist:
- **Core Mechanic**: Is it fun, intuitive, and polished?
- **Visual and Audio Polish**: Do the graphics and sound fit together cohesively?
- **Gameplay Balance**: Is the difficulty balanced, is it fun for multiple types of players, does it have educational value, etc.?
- **Bug-Free Performance**: Have you squashed all major bugs and tested thoroughly?
- **Video**: Is your game’s core idea clear, and have you developed a compelling, concise pitch?

### (If executed properly) With this action plan, you’ll have:
- A working, polished game by Day 5.
- Time to polish, bug fix, and refine in Days 6-7.
- A concise presentation to showcase what makes your game stand out.
  
### Regardless of anything above, the goal is to make something cool, have fun, learn from each other, and build community.

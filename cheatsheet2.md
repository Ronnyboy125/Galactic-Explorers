# Cheat Sheet 2

## Step 1: Divide Roles Based on Strengths
With a 12-person team, the key is to assign roles early and ensure everyone knows what they’re responsible for. You’ll want to cover all aspects of game development, from programming to art, sound, and project management.

### Suggested Role Breakdown:

**Team Leads (2 people):**
- Keep the team on track without micromanaging. You’re here to make sure deadlines are met, goals are reached, and everyone is communicating and engaged in the process.
- **Responsibilities**: Task assignment, time management, ensuring communication flows smoothly. Feel free to wear multiple hats but make sure the former responsibilities are your main concern.
- **Action**: Set up clear task assignments and timelines, but don't forget—everyone’s learning, so it’s all good if things shift a little!

**Lead Programmer (1-2 people):**
- Handle the core mechanics and ensure everything is coded smoothly. You’ll be the go-to for big technical decisions.
- **Responsibilities**: Write clean code, make sure the core gameplay works, and help others when they need a hand.
- **Action**: Make sure core gameplay is solid before moving on to other features. Keep the code organized so everyone can pitch in.

**Programmers (2-3 people):**
- **Responsibilities**: Implement features, UI, and help squash bugs. Pair up newbies with experienced coders for growth.
- **Action**: Start small, make the game fun, and tackle new challenges as a team!

**Artists (2-3 people):**
- Bring the game to life with visuals! Whether it's sprites or animations, keep the style simple but cohesive.
- **Responsibilities**: Create consistent, simple art that matches the game’s vibe.
- **Action**: Get a style guide going early, and work on basic assets as the mechanics are being developed.

**Sound Designer (1-2 people):**
- Don’t underestimate the power of sound! Simple effects or music can make your game pop.
- **Responsibilities**: Source or create sound effects and music that fit the game's mood.
- **Action**: Get placeholder sounds in early so you can tweak them as needed.

**Level Designer (1-2 people):**
- Your job is to design fun levels (or something adjacent) that show off the core mechanic in the best way possible.
- **Responsibilities**: Build engaging, fun levels that showcase the game’s core mechanic.

**Tester/UX/UI Specialist (1-2 people):**
- Ensure the game is easy to play and feels good.
- **Responsibilities**: Playtest, give feedback, and improve the user experience.
- **Action**: Start testing as soon as there’s something playable—help catch bugs and refine the feel of the game.

### Consideration:
- People can (AND SHOULD) wear multiple hats if needed but try to avoid overlapping too much in core areas. Clearly define everyone’s primary responsibility to avoid confusion.
- **Action**: Assign roles and break down tasks during the first meeting. Get agreement on the roles so everyone is on the same page.

## Step 2: Choose the Right Game Environment
The choice of game engine or technology used will heavily influence your workflow. Since you will have a 12-person team, you’ll want to pick something that:
- Is familiar to your team.
- Can handle the scope of your game.
- Supports collaborative development.
- …and most importantly, is easy to use.

### Common Engine/Language Options:

**JavaScript:**
- For the web route, you’ll need to go with a fun and easy JavaScript framework that is capable of facilitating the creation of the game you want to make.
- **Best For**: Accessibility, text-based, 2D platformer (Phaser.js), or even a 3D game (Cannon.js, Babylon.js, Three.js)

**Unity (C#):**
- Good for both 2D and 3D games, has strong community support, and easily accommodates collaboration via Git. Great if you want a flexible engine that can handle a variety of game types.
- **Best For**: Teams that have experience with C#, need flexibility (2D or 3D), and want strong asset management.

**Godot (GDScript, C#):**
- Lightweight and great for 2D games. It’s free, open-source, and easier to learn. Godot has excellent built-in tools for game design and UI.
- **Best For**: Teams that want a simpler, faster workflow and prefer 2D development.

**Unreal Engine (C++):**
- Excellent for high-fidelity 3D games. It’s powerful but has a steeper learning curve, especially for those unfamiliar with C++ or Unreal’s Blueprints.
- **Best For**: Teams experienced in Unreal or working on a high-quality 3D game.

### Consideration:
- You will need to stick to a technology that the majority of your team is comfortable with. Learning a new engine or language during the competition will slow things down significantly.
- **Action**: Discuss and lock in what your team wants to use. Choose based on familiarity and project needs.

## Step 3: Set Up a Realistic Schedule
With a 12-person team, keeping everyone on track is crucial. Clear deadlines and milestones will need to be kept to keep things moving.

### Milestone Breakdown:

**Day 1: Concept and Core Mechanic Locked In**
- **Action**: Agree on your game’s core idea and mechanic, based on the theme from the community partner. Keep it fun and feasible!

**Day 2-3: Core Prototype and Asset Creation**
- Programmers should focus on building the core mechanic.
- Artists should start creating basic assets (characters, UI, environments).
- **Action**: Build a working prototype with placeholder art by the end of Day 3. Test your core mechanic early—does it feel fun to play?

**Day 4-5: Expansion and Level Design**
- **Action**: Once the core gameplay is working, add levels or new features. Make sure every part shows off the best of what your game has to offer!

**Day 6: Polishing and Testing**
- **Action**: Spend this day making the game smooth and bug-free. Refine the visuals, sounds, and gameplay. Playtest everything!

**Day 7: Final Playtesting and Presentation Prep**
- **Action**: This is the home stretch! Polish, squash last-minute bugs, and get your video presentation done. Make sure the most fun parts of your game shine.

### Consideration:
- Factor in time for unforeseen issues (e.g., bugs, delays). Set aside 1-2 hours daily for “buffer time.” Extremely important!
- **Action**: Use Trello or another task management tool to assign and track tasks. The project manager (Team leads) should ensure everyone is engaging with the process and feels included.

## Step 4: Build a Collaborative Workflow
With a team of 12, communication and collaboration are key to avoiding confusion and overlapping work.

### Workflow Setup:

**Version Control**:
- Set up a version control system (WhitGit) to manage code changes. Programmers should merge their work at the end of each day.
- **Action**: Have daily commits, with programmers merging code at the end of each work session.

**Regular Check-ins**:
- Hold brief daily standups to ensure everyone is on track, blockers are identified, and progress is discussed.
- **Action**: Limit standups to 10-15 minutes. Each person gives a quick update on what they did yesterday, what they’re doing today, and any issues they’re facing.

**Art/Code Integration**:
- Make sure the integration between programmers and artists is smooth. Once assets are created, they need to be imported quickly and tested.
- **Action**: The lead programmer and artist(s) should sync up every day to make sure the assets fit into the game smoothly.

### Consideration:
- Without clear communication, things will get chaotic fast. Regular meetings and using collaborative tools will save headaches down the line.
- **Action**: Utilize the Discord server so everyone can communicate easily. Make use of your team channel.

## Step 5: Create a Fun and Clear Presentation
The final presentation is your chance to make an impression. Show off the core mechanic, the game's polish, and the fun factor immediately.

### Video Presentation Plan:

**Show Gameplay Right Away**:
- Get to the core mechanic fast. Let the professors see what makes your game unique within the first 30 seconds.
- **Action**: Prepare the demo that skips straight to the “action”—avoid spending too much time on menus or explanations.

**Explain Challenges and Solutions**:
- Highlight the technical and design challenges you overcame. The professors will like to see how you solve problems creatively.

**Engage the Profs**:
- If possible, allow them to play a small portion of the game, or walk them through the most exciting part.
- **Action**: Have a few team members guide the judges through the game’s most fun or interesting sections if applicable.
